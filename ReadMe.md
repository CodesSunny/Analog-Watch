for hr hand- in 1hr hr hand moves due to its own time + due to min hand movement too
so actual movement of hr hand will be including mov of min hand

360° / 12 = 30° per hour + 0.5° per minute for smooth transition
12 hr = 360deg
1hr = 360/12=30deg
in h hours = 30*h deg
60m = 30deg
1m = 30/60 = 1/2deg
in m mins = 1/2*m deg
3600s =30deg
1s = 30/3600 = .00833deg
in s sec = .00833s deg
total hdeg= 30*h deg+ 1/2*m deg + .00833s deg

for minute hand:  360° / 60 = 6° per minute + 0.1° per second for smooth transition
60 m = 360 deg
1m = 360/60 = 6deg
pn m min = 6*m deg
60sec = 6deg
1sec = 6/60 = .1 deg
in s sec = .1*s deg
total mdeg= 6*m deg+ .1*s deg


for second hand:
60s = 360deg
1s = 360/60 = 6deg
in s sec = 6*sdeg
